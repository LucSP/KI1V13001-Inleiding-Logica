# KI1V13001 - Inleiding Logica

This is the source material for my course *Inleiding Logica (KI1V13001)* at Utrecht University.
The course is a run-of-the-mill intro to mathematical logic for first-year AI students.
The material consists of:
- the lecture notes
- the slides
- the syllabus
- the TA guideline
Everything is in LaTeX.
You can find the source material in the folder `src`.
If you know your way around the command line, you can run `make` in the root directory to create pdfs of everything.

# Contribute

The lifeblood of university courses is the collaboration of the students and the teacher toward the goal of understanding.
Contributing requires basic familiarity with git and GitHub (pretty useful skill for any programming work). 
Get started [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).
You can contribute by:
- If you spot a mistake, have a suggestion for material ("feature request"), etc.: create issue!
If you don't know how to, see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).
- If you know LaTeX, you can correct my mistakes yourself and become a code contributor. 
Create a pull request (see the tutorial above).

# LaTeX

The course material is in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).
Most scientific writing in formal disciplines (math, physics, computer science, ...) is in LaTeX.
So it's a pretty useful skill to learn to write it.
