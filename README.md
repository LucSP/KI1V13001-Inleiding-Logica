## About

This is the source material for the course **Inleiding Logica** (KI1V13001) at Utrecht University.
The material consists of:

  + the syllabus (`lib/syllabus`)
  + the slides (`lib/slides`)
  + the lecture notes (`lib/notes`)

Students currently taking the course can find pdfs of the material under [Course Material](https://github.com/jkorb/KI1V13001-Inleiding-Logica/releases/latest).[^1]

## Contribute

We encourage contributions, especially but not exclusively from past and present students of the course.
Two simple ways of contributing are:

  + *open issues*, for example to point out typos, mistakes, or make feature requests
  + *making pull requests*, for example to fix a mistake yourself and become a [contributor](https://github.com/jkorb/KI1V13001-Inleiding-Logica/graphs/contributors).

If these things don't tell you anything yet, don't despair! 
Check the next two sections.

## GitHub

If you're here and don't know about GitHub already, then you're probably here because you're currently taking the course.
Note that it's not mandatory to learn git/GitHub, but it's a highly valuable skill and it allows you to contribute to the course material: immortalize yourself in our first-year logic course!

A good place to get started on git/GitHub is [here](https://guides.github.com/).

## LaTeX 

The technical bits of the course material are written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).
If you want to contribute, you'll need to learn it. 
Again, this is not mandatory if you're a student taking the course but again, it's a pretty useful skill.
In fact,
most scientific writing in formal disciplines (math, physics, computer science, ...) is done in LaTeX.
Get started here [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials).

The non-technical bits of the material are written in markdown (such as this readme and the syllabus), a *very* simple markup language.
Learn more about it [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
